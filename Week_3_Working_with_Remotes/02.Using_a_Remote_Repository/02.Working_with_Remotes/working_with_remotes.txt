We could have a look at the remote branches that our Git repo is currently tracking by running git branch -r.

If we want to make a change to a remote branch, what must we do?
=>Pull the remote branch, merge it with the local branch, then push it back to its origin.

if (local out of date) shows in - git remote show origin
