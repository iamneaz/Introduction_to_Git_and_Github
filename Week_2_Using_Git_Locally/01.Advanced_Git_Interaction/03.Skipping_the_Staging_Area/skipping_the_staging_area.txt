# If we already know that the current changes are the ones that we want to commit, we can skip the staging step and go directly to the commit
git commit -a --> A shortcut to stage any changes to tracked files and commit them in one step

Example :
git commit -a -m "Call check_reboot from main, exit with 1 on error"

Git uses the head alias to represent the currently checked out snapshot of your project.
