#   MERGING -- THE TERM THAT GIT USES FOR COMBINING BRANCHED DATA AND HISTORY TOGETHER
# merging a branch 
git merge <branch name>
#   When we merge two branches , both branches are pointed at the same commit 
#   Git uses two different algorithms to perform a merge: fast-forward and three-way merge
#   fast-forward merge occurs when all the commits in the checked out branch are also in the branch that's being merged.
#   a three-way merge is performed when the history of the merging branches has diverged in some way, and there isn't a nice linear path to combine them via fast-forwarding. This happens when a commit is made on one branch after the point when both branches split.
