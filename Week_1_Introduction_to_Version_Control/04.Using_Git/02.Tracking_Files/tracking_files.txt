The code and associated files and a series of snapshots. Each time you make a commit, Git records a new snapshot of the state of your project at that moment. It's a picture of exactly how all these files looked at a certain moment in time. Combined, these snapshots make up the history of your project, and it's information that gets stored in the Git directory. Now, let's dive into the details of how we track changes to our files. When we operate with Git, our files can be either tracked or untracked. Tracked files are part of the snapshots, while untracked files aren't a part of snapshots yet. This is the usual case for new files. Each track file can be in one of three main states, modified, staged or committed.
