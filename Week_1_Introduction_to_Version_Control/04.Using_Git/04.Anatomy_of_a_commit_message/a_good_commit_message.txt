the first line is usually kept to about 50 characters or less. The line contains a short description of what the commit changes are about. After the first line, comes an empty line, and the rest of the text is usually kept under 72 characters. This text is intended to provide a detailed explanation of what's going on with the change. It can reference bugs or issues that will be fixed with the change. It can also include links to more information when relevant. The line limits can be annoying but they help in making the commit message be more digestible for the reader.
